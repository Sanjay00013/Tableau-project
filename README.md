Key Concepts Applied

Filter by Context: Applied contextual filters to refine data and ensure relevant insights are displayed.

Relevant Filter Values: Dynamically displayed filter values that update based on user selection, enhancing the user experience.

Charts as Filters: Enabled charts to act as interactive filters for other dashboard components, improving data exploration.

Tooltip Customization: Embedded additional insights into tooltips, making the dashboard more informative without overwhelming the visuals.

Interactive Actions: Created actions between worksheets that allow users to interact with different aspects of the data seamlessly.


This project highlights how Tableau can be used to create insightful dashboards that facilitate better business decisions. The interactive features provide an intuitive way for stakeholders to explore the data and uncover trends.
